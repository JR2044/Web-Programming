Web Programming Github Repository README

My idea is to make simple games to mess around with. 
My first idea will be a simple "Pong" style game though I may attempt to alter the general rules of the game.
Possibilities : Curved board, maybe different versions 

Possibility of other games but not decided but I will update the README as I go forward
